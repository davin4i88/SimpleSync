# SimpleSync [![AppVeyor][appveyor-img]][appveyor-url] [![Discord][discord-img]][discord-url]

SimpleSync is a script for FiveM that allows you to synchronize the Weather, Time and Lights (also called Blackout) between clients. There are multiple modes that you can use:

* Dynamic (Time is increased over time, Weather is changed over time based on the current value)
* Static (the Weather and Time never changes, unless is done manually)
* Real (uses the information of real-life cities via Timezones and OpenWeatherMap for Time and Weather respectively)

Unlike other Synchronization scripts, the resource is highly configurable. You can change the Dynamic Weather switches, the duration of the Time and more options. Developers even have exports that they can use! No more scripts fighting for controlling the Time and Weather.
